    <p>I absolutely love my new car! It drives so smoothly ðŸ˜Š.</p>
    <p>My old car broke down last week, such a terrible experience &amp; I hated it!</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m not sure about this car... itâ€™s okay, I guess ðŸ¤”.</p>
    <p>Car? Meh, I donâ€™t really careâ€”bought it anyway.</p>
    <p><script>alert("Ignore this!");</script>My car is the best, but the price was awful!</p>
    <p>ðŸš— My car is great, but Iâ€™m broke now. ðŸ˜¢</p>
